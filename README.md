This project contains the source code for the Couchbase JDBC Driver which supports Analytics and eventually Query (both with different capabilities).

## Overview

Right now it is a **work in progress** and can only be obtained through the source code. Also, no official enterprise-level support is provided, but feel free to raise a ticket and we'll try to help out as best as we can.

## Usage: Analytics

 - **Current Version:** `0.2.0`
 - JDBC URL Prefix: `jdbc:couchbase:analytics` or `jdbc:cb:analytics` as a fallback.
